# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
I have utilized SQL to answer a wide range of questions related to pizza sales, from basic queries to advanced analyses. The goal was to gain insights into sales patterns, customer preferences, total orders, revenue, peak hours, and each pizza category through comprehensive data analysis.

## Key SQL Techniques Used
- Joins: Combined data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive data view.
- Subqueries: Nested queries to perform advanced filtering and data manipulation.
- Aggregations: Used functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() to summarize data.
- Data Filtering: Applied `WHERE` clauses to focus on specific subsets of data.

## Usage
1. Database Setup: Import the provided SQL schema and data files to set up the database.
2. Running Queries: Execute the SQL queries in the queries directory to perform the analysis.
3. Customization: Modify the queries to fit specific needs or to explore additional questions.
